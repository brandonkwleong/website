<h1>&#8249; About &#8250;</h1>

<h2>I'm a <span id="flat_blue">developer</span></h2>
<p>
I've always loved technology and science. As a kid, you could find me
reading books about physics that were too advanced for my age, or tinkering
unsuccessfully with computer parts. This interest in technology led me to study
Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada. The program
allowed me to experience internships at different technology companies around
North America.
</p>

<p>
During my first year at the UW, I attended my first
formal computer programming class. I will never forget my first day trying to
get "Hello World" to compile... for hours. But despite the early setback, I
quickly developed a passion for the craft, and today, I design, write and deploy
code that people use on a daily basis, and I love it.
</p>

<h2>I'm an <span id="flat_turq">athlete<span></h2>
<p>
Being active has always been an important part of my life. At an early age, I
learned the martial arts from my father. I learned the importance of discipline,
hard work and focus. I eventually branched off and went out to try a myriad of
styles, but mainly Muay Thai, Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu.
</p>
<p>
I started rock climbing in 2015. Now, I am addicted to indoor rock climbing.
Next year I hope to try my hand at bouldering outdoors.
</p>

<h2>I'm an <span id="flat_orange">explorer<span></h2>
<p>
In 2015, I flew to New Zealand's North Island to explore its natural wonders. The highlight
would have to be the Tongariro Alpine Crossing, with its unbelievable scenery. In 2016, I flew to
Hawaii to experience living in a cabin in the middle of the jungle. Every night, the Coqui frogs
would combine with the nightly showers to create the perfect white noise for sleeping.
</p>

<p>
These experiences and more drive me to keep wanting to explore the world. I can't wait to see what's next!
